# MLcourseJune21

You can download the ML Course Final Project's dataset from here. There are a total of **six** files (`Dataset_yesno.z01` `Dataset_yesno.z02` `Dataset_yesno.z03` `Dataset_yesno.z04` `Dataset_yesno.z05` and `Dataset_yesno.zip`). Download all of them and put them together into one folder (the directory you will use to import the data for the project). Then right click on the file Dataset_yesno.zip and extract it. It will extract the data in a folder by the name **"Dataset_yesno"** and your data set will be in this folder.

Good luck!

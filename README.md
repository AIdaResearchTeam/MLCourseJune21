# MLcourseJune21

Zou can download the ML Course Final Project's dataset from here. There are a total of six files (Dataset_yesno.z01 Dataset_yesno.z02 Dataset_yesno.z03 Dataset_yesno.z04 Dataset_yesno.z05 and Dataset_yesno.zip). Download all of them and put them together into one folder (the directory you will use to import the data for the project). Then right click on the file Dataset_yesno.zip and extract it. It will extract the data in a folder by the name "Dataset_yesno" and your data set will be in this folder.

Good luck!
